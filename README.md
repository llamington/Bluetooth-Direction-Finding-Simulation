# Interactive Bluetooth Direction Finding Simulation
This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook for simulating the [Bluetooth Direction Finding](https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/using-bluetooth-direction-finding-for-high-accuracy-indoor-positioning/) feature introduced with Bluetooth 5.1.
The notebook leverages [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for interactivity, identifying how system parameters affect the accuracy of direction estimation. The MUSIC algorithm was applied as directed [here](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug103-18-bluetooth-direction-finding-fundamentals.pdf).
